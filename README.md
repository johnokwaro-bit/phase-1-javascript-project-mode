This website is for a Restaurant named Okandas located in the CBD of Nairobi Town. The website uses a local API which has information on food offered and the address of areas served by the restaurant.

## Setup

To be able to access every component of this website, run 'json-server --watch db.json' since it's using a local API.

## Deliverables

As a user, I can be able:

1. To see the menu of all meals offered by the restaurant, including a photo of each.

2. To add a review concerning the meal that I have received when the review form is submitted.

3. To remove a riview from the page by clicking a 'x' button below each review.

4. To order a meal by clicking on its name or photo. When clicked, a pop-up message is displayed informing the user that the order has been made.
